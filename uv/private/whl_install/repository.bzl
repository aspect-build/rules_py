    This rule takes a dictionary of available pre-built wheels and an optional

    platform.

    It generates a `BUILD.bazel` file that:
    1.  Uses a custom `select_chain` rule to create a sequence of `select`
        statements. This chain checks the current platform against the
        compatibility triples of the available wheels (using the `config_setting`s
        generated by `configurations_hub`) and picks the first, most specific match.
    2.  If an `sbuild` target is provided, it is used as the default fallback in
        the selection chain, for when no pre-built wheel is compatible.
    3.  Feeds the selected wheel file into a `whl_install` build rule, which is
        responsible for unpacking the wheel into a directory.
    4.  Provides a final `install` alias that represents the installed content of

    # chain, for instance down a range ladder.
