"""Create a repository to hold the toolchains

This follows guidance here:
https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/deploying.html#registering-toolchains
"
Note that in order to resolve toolchains in the analysis phase
Bazel needs to analyze all toolchain targets that are registered.
Bazel will not need to analyze all targets referenced by toolchain.toolchain attribute.
If in order to register toolchains you need to perform complex computation in the repository,
consider splitting the repository with toolchain targets
from the repository with <LANG>_toolchain targets.
Former will be always fetched,
and the latter will only be fetched when user actually needs to build <LANG> code.
"
The "complex computation" in our case is simply downloading our pre-built rust binaries.
This guidance tells us how to avoid that: we put the toolchain targets in the alias repository
with only the toolchain attribute pointing into the platform-specific repositories.
