"""py_image_layer macro for creating multiple layers from a py_binary

> [!WARNING]
> This macro is EXPERIMENTAL and is not subject to our SemVer guarantees.

A py_binary that uses `torch` and `numpy` can use the following layer groups:

```

    For better performance, it is recommended to split the output of a py_binary into multiple layers.
    This can be done by grouping files into layers based on their path by using the `layer_groups` attribute.

    The matching order for layer groups is as follows:
        1. `layer_groups` are checked first.
        2. If no match is found for `layer_groups`, the `default layer groups` are checked.
        3. Any remaining files are placed into the default layer.
    
    The default layer groups are:
    ```
    {
        "packages": "\\.runfiles/.*/site-packages",, # contains third-party deps
        "interpreter": "\\.runfiles/python.*-.*/", # contains the python interpreter
    }
    ```

    Args:
        name: base name for targets
        py_binary: a py_binary target
        root: Path to where the layers should be rooted. If not specified, the layers will be rooted at the workspace root.
        layer_groups: Additional layer groups to create. They are used to group files into layers based on their path. In the form of: ```{"<name>": "regex_to_match_against_file_paths"}```
        compress: Compression algorithm to use. Default is gzip. See: https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/tar.md#tar_rule
        tar_args: Additional arguments to pass to the tar rule. Default is `["--options", "gzip:!timestamp"]`. See: https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/tar.md#tar_rule
        **kwargs: attribute that apply to all targets expanded by the macro

    Returns:
        A list of labels for each layer.
