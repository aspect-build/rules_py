# --- Runfiles-based interpreter setup ---

# If the runfiles dir is unset AND we will fail to find a runfiles manifest
# based on inspecting $0, we need to try something different.
#
# What this means is that:
#
# - This script isn't being loaded from `bazel run`
#
# - The script is likely being loaded directly as "activate" rather than via a
#   launcher binary in which case the manifest would be obvious
#
# So we need to try and find the runfiles manifest by other means.

       # find the manifest file and runfiles tree relative to the execroot.
